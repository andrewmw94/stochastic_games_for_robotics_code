# Description 

This folder contains script to construct the manipulation domain where the robot interacts with a small box and a tall box. 

## Stochasticity in Robot action
The probability of failure (in successfully executing the action) is higher when manipulating smaller boxes as the robot needs to reach very close to the ground. Thus, form every robot action corresponding to the small box has non-zero proability of going into a loced state.


## Stochasticity in Human action

We modify the human actions and add stochasticity in intervening. The probability of human intervening is higher for locations that are closer to human as opposed to locations that farther away.
